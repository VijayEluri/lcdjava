## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Big rename! Project is now packaged under *org.lcdproc.lcdjava*.
  Before it was *org.boncey.lcdjava*.

## 0.5.0 - 2016-08-31
### Added
- First packaged release after over 10 years from the start of the
  project. There have been no major API changes in this version
  compared to the old unreleased code, but there is probably some minor
  thing that is different. It does however require a modern JDK (1.8)
  and Maven has replaced Ant as the build system.
