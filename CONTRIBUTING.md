=======================

Github standard procedure. Submit issues if you find bugs. Clone, edit and create PR to submit patches.

Branches
========

The tip of *master* is kept at high quality. Changes may be committed directly to *master* but there are no force-pushes to this branch.

Sometimes half-finished work is committed to *dev*. This branch is unstable, may be rewritten at any time and might not even build. Eventually *dev* is taken to production quality and is merged into *master*.

Feature branches may be considered at a later stage if/when there is more than one contributor.
