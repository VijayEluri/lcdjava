Java client for LCDproc (http://lcdproc.org/).

Code status: untested and possibly out of date.

I used to use this with LCDproc on Linux a few years back but I have stopped using it now.
I don't even have an LCD display hooked up anymore so am unable to test it.


However, when I did use it seemed to work fine - I ran it as part of my Wiphi home music player project (http://boncey.org/tags/wiphi).

I'm happy to answer questions about the code via http://github.com/boncey/lcdjava.
